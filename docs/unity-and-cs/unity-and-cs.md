# Beginning in Unity

Welcome to this quick start to Unity!

Unity is a free to use, game engine that supports both 3D and 2D game developement. This is software that is used professionally for game and app developement.

[List of games made in Unity (If you want examples)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unity_games)


You may choose between 2D or 3D games for the project you want to work on. Each has their own pros and cons to work with. 

Unity was built for 3D games and the coding seems to be  mostly built for 3D. For 3D, you probably won't be making your own models which means you will have to use premade models from other people. 

For 2D games, it's easy to get the assets you may need but harder to code them to do what you want.

For this tutorial we will be following a simple [Unity 3D tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFlh8pTf4DU&list=PLX2vGYjWbI0Q-s4_lX0h4i2zbZqlg4OfF) that will help you understand how Unity works.


Follow along with the whole tutorial(or at least watch it) and you should be set to work on your own game! 

*Remember!* Google is a really good resource when you get stuck. Try to do what you need without Google and if you can't get it, *then* use Google. (If you still need help you can ask someone in the room)
