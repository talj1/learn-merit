# Setup

## Is it Art, Math, or Computer Science?

Have a look at the image below. How would you describe it? Is is art, math, or computer science?

It’s a computer-generated image, but making it requires an understanding of art, maths, and computer science. Let’s see how you too can make images just like this.

## Download Greenfoot

To download the Greenfoot Java IDE, visit [https://greenfoot.org/downloads](https://greenfoot.org/downloads) and the select the appropriate package for your operating system. Greenfoot is already installed on Raspberry Pis if you happen to be using one, and can be accessed from the Programming menu.

## Set Up Scenario

A Scenario is a Greenfoot project. To create one, click on the "Scenario" tab and select "New Scenario". Name it `turtley-amazing`.

![new scenario dialog box](/assets/images/java/turtley-amazing/new.png)

You will see the `World` and `Actor` classes on the right. The `World` is the environment and `Actors` are objects that we can place in the environment.

### Create an Actor

We will create a child of the Actor class that can move around the screen and draw our pictures. Right click the `Actor` class and select `New subclass`.

![greenfoot new sub class graphic user interface](/assets/images/java/turtley-amazing/newSubClass.png)

Name the class `Turtle` and for its image, select `animals` and find the tiny turtle picture. Then, click OK. This will create the Turtle class where we will put all of our code.

When back on the Scenario, you should see our Turtle class inheriting from the Actor class. Right-click the `Turtle` class and select `Open editor` to open the code for editing.

## Move the Turtle

In the code, you will see an `act()` method. This method is called (executed) every time you press the `> Act` button on the main interface. We can use the `move()` method to move our Turtle across the screen like so (modify the `act()` method to include `move()`):

```java
public void act()
{
    // Add your action code here
    move(10);
}
```

Your code will look something like this. Hit the `compile` button at the top of the screen to translate the Java into bytecode that the Greenfoot environment can execute.

Then you can return to the main interface (the scenario) and do these two things to run your code:

- Instantiate a Turtle object (create an object from the Turtle class and put it in the World, the World is the big white screen). Right-click on the Turtle class and select `new Turtle()`. Then click in the World where you want to place it.

- Click `> Act` to see the Turtle move 10 pixels, just as our code instructed it to.
