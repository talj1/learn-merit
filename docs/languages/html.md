HTML is the markup language of websites and web applications. It's the way that content (text, graphics, and other media) is defined and organized on a web page. HTML by itself does not look fantastic. To style the content defined by HTML (add fonts, colors, layouts, etc. to your web pages), you need to learn <a href="/">CSS</a>.<br>
<strong>It is highly recommended that you learn HTML and CSS at the same time.</strong>

## Tutorials

Provides more detailed and accurate explanations than w3schools.
3. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">codecademy</a><br><strong>For those who want to get a brief overview and learn by doing</strong><br>Codecademy has a great free mini course for learning HTML. It does require an account but teaches the basics quickly and effectively.

## Introductory Examples and Resources

There are a few things to know that are essential for coding HTML:

### Tags

<b>Tags</b> define the content on the page. There are distinct tags for headings (titles), paragraphs, images, links, etc. Most <b>HTML elements</b> have an opening and closing tag because they encapsulate text or other content. Fewer elements are <b>singleton tags</b>, like images.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<img src="link-to-image.jpg">
<a href="link-to-page.html">Link</a>
```

<b>Attributes</b> are options that further define the content. For example, an image tag has a source attribute (src) that references the image file to be displayed (```<img src="filename.jpg">```).

### Conventions

<i>If you're unconvinced that following convention is important, visit this page.</i>

Tags should always be lowercase (```<h1>``` not ```<H1>```).

Attributes should be lowercase and values should always be in quotes (```width="200px"``` not ```WIDTH=200px```).

When multiple elements are <b>nested</b> inside one another, it is good practice to match the indentation (horizontal spacing) of the elements.

```html
<main>
    <section>
        <p>Some text</p>
    </section>
</main>
```

File names should be kebab case (lowercase with dashes instead of spaces; ```file-name.html```) or snake case (lowercase with underscores; ```file_name.html```). Be consistent, pick either kebab case or snake case for your files and stick to it.
